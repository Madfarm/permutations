# Single Responsibility Principle
Pieces of code should only do one thing
Functions hould be simplified to accomplishing one thing

# Open - Closed Principle
code is open for extension but closed for modifying

when you need to add a new feature instead of modifying the original class you extend the class

# Interface Segregation Principle
Interfaces should be broken into smaller interfaces with the end goal being that classes only depend on methods they actually use

# Dependency Inversion Principle
